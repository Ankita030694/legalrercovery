  // FAQs List (10 comprehensive, detailed Q&As)
  const faqs: FAQ[] = useMemo(() => [
    {
      id: "faq-1",
      question: "What is the limitation period to file a civil recovery suit for security deposit or unpaid rent in India?",
      answer: "Under the Limitation Act, 1963, you have three years to file a civil recovery case. For tenants, this clock starts on the day you vacate or when the landlord denies the refund. For landlords, it starts when rent falls overdue. Written acknowledgment of the debt by either party resets this three-year period."
    },
    {
      id: "faq-2",
      question: "What is the security deposit cap under the Model Tenancy Act, 2021?",
      answer: "The Model Tenancy Act (MTA), 2021 sets clear limits on security deposits. Landlords cannot charge more than two months' rent for residential homes. For commercial properties, the limit is six months' rent. These caps protect tenants from unfair upfront demands in states that adopted the Act."
    },
    {
      id: "faq-3",
      question: "Can a landlord legally deduct painting charges or general cleaning from the security deposit?",
      answer: "No, unless your signed agreement clearly allows it. Painting, minor wall scuffs, and deep cleaning fall under normal wear and tear. Maintaining the property is the landlord's legal responsibility. Landlords can only deduct costs for actual structural damages or unpaid utility bills."
    },
    {
      id: "faq-4",
      question: "What legal options do landlords have if a tenant refuses to pay rent and refuses to vacate?",
      answer: "Landlords must follow legal steps. Cutting off water or electricity is illegal and invites police action. First, send an advocate-backed legal notice demanding payment and lease termination within 15 days. If the tenant still stays, file an eviction petition with the Rent Authority or Civil Court."
    },
    {
      id: "faq-5",
      question: "Is an unregistered lease agreement legally enforceable for recovering deposits or rent?",
      answer: "Under the Registration Act, 1908, leases of 12 months or longer must be registered. An unregistered long-term lease has limited evidentiary value in court. However, standard 11-month rental agreements do not require central registration. They remain fully enforceable in civil courts to recover dues."
    },
    {
      id: "faq-6",
      question: "Can a landlord withhold the security deposit if the tenant vacates before the lock-in period ends?",
      answer: "It depends on your contract. If the lease specifically states that early exit forfeits the deposit, the landlord may keep it. Without an explicit forfeiture clause, the landlord must refund the deposit. They can only claim actual rent losses while searching for a replacement tenant."
    },
    {
      id: "faq-7",
      question: "How do I approach the Rent Authority under the Model Tenancy Act, 2021?",
      answer: "In states with active Rent Authorities, you can file your petition online or in person. Attach your rental deed, payment receipts, and legal notices. The Authority summons the opposite party and conducts a summary hearing. Orders from the Rent Authority can be appealed within 30 days."
    },
    {
      id: "faq-8",
      question: "What is Mesne Profits, and when can a landlord demand it?",
      answer: "Mesne profits are financial damages paid by a tenant who stays unlawfully after a lease ends. Under Section 2(12) of the CPC, landlords can claim this compensation. It is usually calculated at current market rent or double the monthly rate for the unauthorized period."
    },
    {
      id: "faq-9",
      question: "Can a tenant adjust the final months' rent against the security deposit?",
      answer: "Tenants cannot adjust rent against the deposit without the landlord's written consent. The deposit is held to cover unpaid utility bills and physical damages after vacating. Unilateral adjustments breach the contract, allowing the landlord to demand interest and late fees."
    },
    {
      id: "faq-10",
      question: "What should I do if my landlord has moved out of the country or is an NRI?",
      answer: "You can still recover your money. Serve the legal notice to the landlord's email, their Power of Attorney holder, and the rented property address. If ignored, file a summary suit in the local civil court. The court can attach the property or its rental income to settle your decree."

Their practicing advocate drafted a 3+1 notice pipeline citing the Model Tenancy Act guidelines. The landlord returned our entire deposit of ₹75,000 within 5 days of the first notice."

The triple-escalation notice campaign launched by LegalRecovery reached the directors and institutional partners. The company settled the entire arrears along with delay interest within 12 days."

      review: "Tenants damaged my residential apartment's marble flooring, broke modular kitchen fittings, and vacated quietly. The cost of actual repairs was ₹1.8 Lakhs. LegalRecovery prepared a meticulous pre-litigation warning along with a criminal police complaint draft for mischief and damage to property. The tenants immediately transferred the full repair cost."

      rating: 5,
      review: "I paid a booking advance of ₹50,000 for a rented villa, but the deal fell through because the landlord could not clear structural repairs before move-in. The landlord went silent. LegalRecovery sent an advocate notice outlining the Indian Contract Act. The landlord refunded my ₹50,000 advance with interest within 48 hours. Phenomenal speed!"

                <h2 id="service-overview">1. Professional Security Deposit &amp; Rental Recovery Service</h2>
                <p>
                  Tenancy is a legal agreement with clear rights for both parties. Whether you rent a flat, an office, or commercial space, both sides must follow the law. Unfortunately, rental disputes happen often in India.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For <strong className="font-extrabold text-[#111827]">tenants</strong>, disputes usually happen when moving out. Many landlords withhold security deposits unfairly. They claim fake painting charges or normal wear and tear that is legally the landlord&apos;s job. For <strong className="font-extrabold text-[#111827]">landlords</strong>, problems arise when tenants stop paying rent, leave utility bills unpaid, or refuse to vacate.
                </p>
                <p>
                  LegalRecovery helps resolve these disputes quickly. Going to civil rent court can take years. We replace slow court litigation with a fast, advocate-signed escalation notice process. This compels the other party to settle quickly to avoid penalties and court action.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <strong>Our Service Promise:</strong> We provide full recovery support for a flat fee. We take <strong>zero commission</strong> on your recovered money. We draft, verify, and send legally binding notices directly to the opposite party.
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  Landlords cannot withhold deposits for normal wear, and tenants cannot live rent-free. Let our legal platform handle your recovery claim so you get your money back.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Rental disputes require clear evidence. Our advocate panel reviews your agreement and drafts tailored demands for your situation:
                </p>
                
                <h3 id="unreturned-security-deposits">A. Unreturned Security Deposits (For Tenants)</h3>
                <p>
                  We recover security deposits withheld by landlords. We contest unjustified deductions and demand statutory interest for every day of delay.
                </p>

                <h3 id="unpaid-rent-arrears">B. Unpaid Rent &amp; Utility Arrears (For Landlords)</h3>
                <p>
                  If a tenant vacated without paying rent or electricity bills, we locate their current address and send formal recovery notices.
                </p>

                <h3 id="property-damage">C. Compensation for Property Damages (For Landlords)</h3>
                <p>
                  We recover costs for serious, documented damage caused by tenants to fittings, flooring, or walls. We gather repair estimates and demand reimbursement under the Contract Act.
                </p>

                <h3 id="commercial-lease">D. Commercial Lease Defaults &amp; Lock-in Period Claims</h3>
                <p>
                  Commercial leases are strictly binding contracts. If a corporate tenant breaks a lock-in period or defaults on rent, we launch an aggressive contractual recovery claim.
                </p>

                <h3 id="booking-token">E. Booking Advances &amp; Token Money Refunds</h3>
                <p>
                  If you paid token money to reserve a rental property but the deal failed due to landlord title issues, we demand a full refund under the Indian Contract Act.

                <p>

                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>The Model Tenancy Act, 2021:</strong> Caps security deposits at two months for homes and six months for commercial spaces (Section 11). Fast-tracks dispute resolution before Rent Authorities.</li>
                  <li><strong>The Transfer of Property Act, 1882 (Section 108):</strong> Confirms that normal wear and tear is the landlord&apos;s responsibility. Landlords cannot use force or evict tenants without a court order.</li>
                  <li><strong>Normal Wear and Tear vs. Actual Damages:</strong> Wall fading, minor scuffs, and age-related wear are normal wear and tear. Actual damages include broken tiles, damaged furniture, or altered walls.</li>
                  <li><strong>Order 37 of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908:</strong> Allows landlords or tenants to file a fast-track Summary Suit based on written rent agreements.</li>
                  <li><strong>State Rent Control Acts:</strong> Local rent control laws protect against arbitrary rent hikes and outline exact legal grounds for eviction.</li>

                <p>
                  Many tenants and landlords copy free templates from the web. In real rental disputes, generic templates rarely work:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>No Lawyer Signature:</strong> Casual letters on plain paper carry no real legal threat. A notice on a practicing advocate&apos;s letterhead shows you are serious about taking court action.</li>
                  <li><strong>Missing State-Specific Rules:</strong> Rent laws vary by state. Standard templates miss vital local rules under the Maharashtra Rent Act, Delhi Rent Control Act, or Model Tenancy Act.</li>
                  <li><strong>No Compounding Pressure:</strong> A single generic letter is easily ignored. Without progressive escalations and criminal breach of trust drafts, the other party rarely acts.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  LegalRecovery provides attorney-verified, state-specific notice campaigns. We track delivery in real time so the opposite party cannot claim non-receipt.

                <p>
                  To initiate your case on our platform, you will need to gather simple, standard tenancy records to establish your claim. Our advocates will utilize these records to compile a flawless case profile:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Rent Agreement (Lease Deed):</strong> Proves the identity of landlord/tenant, property details, security deposit amount, notice period, and monthly rent.</li>
                  <li><strong>Bank Transaction Receipts:</strong> Serves as absolute proof of the initial security deposit paid in advance and shows the history of monthly rent transfers.</li>
                  <li><strong>Move-in & Move-out Photos/Videos:</strong> Proves the initial and final condition of the property, showing that no unauthorized damages were caused by the tenant.</li>
                  <li><strong>Written Correspondence:</strong> Email trails or WhatsApp screenshots showing repeated demands for deposit refunds or rent arrears notifications.</li>
                  <li><strong>Utility Bill Receipts:</strong> Copies of the final cleared electricity, water, and internet bills up to the date of handing over keys.</li>
                </ul>
