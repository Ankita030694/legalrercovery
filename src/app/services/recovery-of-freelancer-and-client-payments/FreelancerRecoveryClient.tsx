  // FAQs List (10 comprehensive, detailed Q&As rewritten for high readability)
  const faqs: FAQ[] = useMemo(() => [
    {
      id: "faq-1",
      question: "What is the limitation period to file a legal suit for recovering unpaid freelancer or client payments in India?",
      answer: "Under the Limitation Act 1963, you have three years to file a recovery suit. The limitation period starts from the default date or invoice due date. Any written email acknowledging the debt resets the three-year clock under Section 18."
    },
    {
      id: "faq-2",
      question: "Are email trails, Slack messages, or WhatsApp chats legally binding contracts for freelancers?",
      answer: "Yes. Section 10A of the Indian Contract Act 1872 recognizes electronic contracts. Written agreements on Slack, email, or WhatsApp form a binding contract. You can use these chats as primary evidence in court under electronic record rules."
    },
    {
      id: "faq-3",
      question: "What is MSME Samadhaan, and can a freelance designer, developer, or consultant use it?",
      answer: "Yes. Freelancers with a free Udyam registration qualify as micro or small enterprises. Under the MSMED Act 2006, clients must pay within 45 days. If they default, you can claim compound interest at three times the RBI bank rate."
    },
    {
      id: "faq-4",
      question: "Can a client legally use my work (designs, code, content) if they refuse to clear my final invoice?",
      answer: "No. Under the Indian Copyright Act 1957, intellectual property transfers only after full payment. Using unpaid designs, code, or content without clearing your invoice constitutes copyright infringement. You can demand immediate removal and statutory damages."
    },
    {
      id: "faq-5",
      question: "What is a Summary Suit under Order 37 CPC, and how does it benefit freelancers?",
      answer: "Order 37 CPC provides a fast-track civil court process for unpaid invoices. Defending clients cannot drag out proceedings with false claims. They must apply for leave to defend within 10 days, or the court awards you a summary decree."
    },
    {
      id: "faq-6",
      question: "What should I do if a client's cheque for milestone payment bounces?",
      answer: "A bounced cheque is a criminal offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. You must send an advocate notice within 30 days of the bounce memo. If the client fails to pay within 15 days, you can file a criminal case."
    },
    {
      id: "faq-7",
      question: "Can I recover payments from international clients based outside India?",
      answer: "Yes. We send legal notices through registered digital channels to their overseas office. International companies want to protect their brand and avoid copyright infringement claims. We can also file DMCA takedowns if they use your work without payment."
    },
    {
      id: "faq-8",
      question: "What is 'Scope Creep', and how do I legally recover payments for unapproved extra work?",
      answer: "Scope creep happens when clients request extra tasks outside the original contract. You can recover payment if you have written messages confirming the extra scope. Under Section 70 of the Contract Act, courts award reasonable compensation for completed work."
    },
    {
      id: "faq-9",
      question: "How long does a legal notice take to show results in client payment disputes?",
      answer: "About 80% of client payment disputes settle within the 15-day notice window. Businesses prefer to avoid public MSME disputes, court lawsuits, and copyright claims. Most clients clear the invoice or offer a settlement schedule quickly."
    },
    {
      id: "faq-10",
      question: "What criminal actions can a freelancer take against a client who fraudulently refuses to pay?",
      answer: "If a client hired you with dishonest intent, you can take criminal action. You can file a police complaint for cheating (Section 420 IPC) and criminal breach of trust (Section 405/406 IPC). This creates personal accountability for company directors."

LegalRecovery sent an advocate notice outlining the Indian Contract Act and Copyright Act violations. They pointed out that using my designs on production without clearing dues was illegal.

                <h2 id="service-overview">1. Professional Freelancer & Client Payments Recovery Service</h2>
                <p>
                  Freelance professionals, designers, developers, and consultants power the modern digital economy. Yet independent creators often face delayed client payments and ignored invoices. Many clients count on freelancers abandoning dues because of high legal costs.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Clients frequently stop replying once they receive the final deliverables. Others demand endless revisions or use draft work in production without paying. Some clients cancel contracts abruptly, violating agreed notice terms.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our <strong className="font-extrabold text-[#111827]">Freelancer and Client Payments Recovery Service</strong> evens the playing field. We turn payment recovery into an automated, attorney-verified legal pipeline. We serve notices directly to founders, finance heads, and directors to resolve disputes fast.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <strong>Our Service Promise:</strong> We provide flat-fee recovery support with <strong>zero commission</strong> on your recovered money. We draft, verify, and deliver firm legal notices directly to company leadership.
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  No business can legally use your creative work without paying for it. We handle drafting, notice delivery, and tracking so you can recover your rightful earnings.

                <h2 id="coverage-details">2. Freelancer & Client Dues We Help You Recover</h2>
                <p>
                  Freelance payment disputes often involve multiple billing components. Our legal team calculates every unpaid balance to maximize your claim:
                </p>
                
                <h3 id="milestone-payments">A. Milestone & Final Project Payouts</h3>
                <p>
                  We recover unpaid milestone balances and final project invoices. When clients accept work but delay payments, we issue a formal demand backed by delivery logs.
                </p>

                <h3 id="retainer-fees">B. Unpaid Monthly Retainer Fees</h3>
                <p>
                  For ongoing consulting or marketing retainers, we claim unpaid monthly fees. We enforce contract terms, late fees, and notice-period payouts when clients cancel without cause.
                </p>

                <h3 id="scope-creep">C. Scope Creep & Unauthorized Revisions</h3>
                <p>
                  Clients often ask for revisions outside the agreed Statement of Work. Under the doctrine of *Quantum Meruit* in the Contract Act, we demand fair compensation for extra work.
                </p>

                <h3 id="contract-breaches">D. Contract Breaches & Premature Terminations</h3>
                <p>
                  When a client cancels a contract without required notice, you are entitled to damages. We claim your notice-period pay and agreed severance amounts.
                </p>

                <h3 id="unauthorized-work">E. Compensation for Intellectual Property Theft</h3>
                <p>
                  Under Indian law, your creative work remains yours until paid for in full. If a client uses your code, designs, or content without clearing dues, we demand damages for copyright infringement.

                <ul>
                  <li><strong>The Indian Contract Act, 1872:</strong> Recognizes electronic contracts and emails as binding under Sections 10 and 10A. Unilateral non-payment breaches contract law.</li>
                  <li><strong>The Copyright Act, 1957 (Section 19 & 19A):</strong> States that copyright transfers only after invoice payment. Using unpaid work constitutes copyright infringement.</li>
                  <li><strong>MSMED Act, 2006 & MSME Samadhaan:</strong> Mandates client payment within 45 days for registered MSMEs. Defaults attract compound interest at <strong className="font-extrabold text-[#111827]">three times the RBI bank rate</strong>.</li>
                  <li><strong>Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (Order 37 Summary Suit):</strong> Offers a fast-track court procedure to recover debts based on written contracts and invoices.</li>
                  <li><strong>Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881:</strong> Provides criminal prosecution and penalties when client cheques bounce.</li>

                <p>
                  Many creators use free legal notice formats found online. These generic templates rarely get results:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>No Advocate Verification:</strong> Free templates lack the seal and signature of a practicing advocate. Corporate legal teams easily ignore them.</li>
                  <li><strong>Missing IP and Copyright Claims:</strong> Generic formats overlook that using unpaid work violates Section 63 of the Copyright Act. Copyright claims create stronger settlement pressure.</li>
                  <li><strong>No Structured Escalation:</strong> One lone letter is easy to ignore. We provide tracked digital delivery and weekly escalations to executive leadership.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                  To start your recovery, gather common project records. Our advocates will use these documents to build your claim:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Service Agreement or Statement of Work (SOW):</strong> Defines deliverables, pricing, milestones, payment schedules, and notice rules.</li>
                  <li><strong>Tax Invoices:</strong> Shows invoice numbers, GST details, bank accounts, and agreed payment terms.</li>
                  <li><strong>Proof of Work Delivery:</strong> GitHub pull requests, Figma links, Google Drive logs, or email delivery records.</li>
                  <li><strong>Written Messages:</strong> Admissible email threads, Slack chats, or WhatsApp messages confirming work approvals.</li>
                  <li><strong>Bank Account Statement:</strong> Serves as proof that the client never transferred the pending amount.</li>
                </ul>
