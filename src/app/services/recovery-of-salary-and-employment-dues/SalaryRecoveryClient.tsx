  // FAQs List (10 comprehensive, detailed Q&As rewritten for high readability)
  const faqs: FAQ[] = useMemo(() => [
    {
      id: "faq-1",
      question: "What is the time limit or limitation period to file a legal suit for salary recovery in India?",
      answer: "Under the Limitation Act 1963, you have three years to file a recovery suit. The clock starts from the date your salary became due. For labour commissioner claims, you should ideally file within 12 months. However, courts can condone delays if you show sufficient cause."
    },
    {
      id: "faq-2",
      question: "Can an employer legally withhold my salary during a notice period?",
      answer: "No. Employers cannot withhold salary during your notice period. Notice pay and monthly wages are legal employee rights. Withholding them breaches your contract and state Shops and Establishments Acts. Handover disputes must be settled separately without stopping your earnings."
    },
    {
      id: "faq-3",
      question: "What is the distinction between a 'Workman' and a 'Non-Workman' under Indian labor laws?",
      answer: "Section 2(s) of the Industrial Disputes Act 1947 defines a workman. It includes technical, clerical, manual, and operational staff. It excludes staff who hold primarily managerial or administrative roles. Non-workmen and senior managers recover unpaid salary through civil courts."
    },
    {
      id: "faq-4",
      question: "What are the legal consequences for an employer who refuses to pay Full and Final (F&F) dues?",
      answer: "Defaulting employers face labour department inquiries, civil recovery suits, and legal penalties. Courts can award unpaid wages with interest between 12% and 18% per year. In willful default cases, company directors can face direct legal liability."
    },
    {
      id: "faq-5",
      question: "Can I approach the NCLT (Insolvency Court) for unpaid salary recovery?",
      answer: "Yes. Employees are recognized as Operational Creditors under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). You can issue a Section 8 demand notice. If unpaid dues cross ₹1 crore, employees can join together to file an insolvency petition."
    },
    {
      id: "faq-6",
      question: "How long does it take for a legal notice to show results for unpaid salaries?",
      answer: "Most employers respond within 15 days of receiving an advocate notice. Companies want to avoid public labour disputes and court litigation. Responsible firms usually clear undisputed dues or propose a payment schedule quickly."
    },
    {
      id: "faq-7",
      question: "Are startup employees protected under the Payment of Wages Act?",
      answer: "Yes. Startup employees enjoy full legal protection under state Shops and Establishments Acts. Employers must pay monthly wages by the 7th or 10th of each month. Startups cannot use cash flow issues or funding delays to withhold earned pay."
    },
    {
      id: "faq-8",
      question: "What is wrongful termination, and can I recover damages for it?",
      answer: "Wrongful termination happens when an employer fires staff without required contractual notice or fair inquiry. In such cases, you can legally demand back wages and contractual notice pay. You can also claim damages for mental harassment."
    },
    {
      id: "faq-9",
      question: "Can an employer adjust my pending salary against training bonds or non-compete clauses?",
      answer: "No. Section 7 of the Payment of Wages Act bars unilateral pay deductions. Employers cannot hold earned salary hostage over training bonds. A company must pay your earned salary first and file a separate civil claim for disputed bonds."
    },
    {
      id: "faq-10",
      question: "What should I do if my employer has closed the office or is absconding?",
      answer: "First, send your legal notice to the company's MCA registered address and directors' homes. Second, file a police complaint for criminal breach of trust under Section 405/406 IPC. Third, submit a claim before the local Labour Commissioner."

The company released my entire pending amount along with written apology letters within just 10 days of the first notice. Absolutely outstanding service!"

LegalRecovery guided me through the workman classification and sent structured notices detailing the Shops & Establishments Act violations. The management immediately agreed to a settlement, paying my 2 months' notice pay and pending salary. Highly recommended!"

The notice sent by LegalRecovery outlined the breach of contract under the Indian Contract Act. The client cleared the full payment within 48 hours. Incredible speed and legal efficiency."

LegalRecovery prepared a systematic draft including the Payment of Gratuity Act provisions. The Controlling Authority application and notice process forced the company to settle. I received my full gratuity plus interest!"

                <h2 id="service-overview">1. Professional Salary & Employment Dues Recovery Service</h2>
                <p>
                  Employment is a legally binding contract. When an employer delays salary or withholds your Full and Final settlement, they breach the contract. This also violates statutory Indian labour laws.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our <strong className="font-extrabold text-[#111827]">Salary and Employment Dues Recovery Service</strong> protects your workplace rights. Many companies rely on employees walking away due to the cost of regular litigation. We solve this through a swift, structured, attorney-backed recovery process.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <strong>Our Service Promise:</strong> We provide complete recovery support for a flat fee. We take <strong>zero commission</strong> on your recovered money. We draft, verify, and deliver firm legal notices directly to company leadership.
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  No company can lawfully withhold your earned earnings. We manage drafting, notice delivery, and tracking so you can recover what is rightfully yours.
                </p>

                <h2 id="coverage-details">2. Salary & Employment Dues We Help You Recover</h2>
                <p>
                  Salary claims often include multiple pay components. Our legal panel calculates every pending amount to build an airtight claim.
                </p>
                
                <h3 id="unpaid-salaries">A. Unpaid Salaries & Cumulative Delayed Wages</h3>
                <p>
                  We recover unpaid base salaries, HRA, and standard monthly allowances shown on your appointment letter. State Shops and Establishments laws strictly punish employers who withhold monthly wages.
                </p>

                <h3 id="ff-settlements">B. Unpaid Full & Final (F&F) Settlement Dues</h3>
                <p>
                  Companies must settle all accounts promptly upon resignation or termination. Our notice demands immediate release of your full F&F balance under statutory payment timelines.
                </p>

                <h3 id="incentives">C. Performance Bonuses, Commissions & Incentives</h3>
                <p>
                  Employers often call bonuses discretionary to avoid paying them. When target terms are documented and achieved, they become legally enforceable debts.
                </p>

                <h3 id="notice-severance">D. Notice Period Salaries & Severance Pay</h3>
                <p>
                  If a company terminates you without notice, you are entitled to notice pay. We recover your contractually guaranteed notice salary and agreed severance benefits.

                <p>
                  Indian law strongly protects worker rights. Our advocates use these statutes to compel defaulting employers to pay:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>The Payment of Wages Act, 1936:</strong> Requires timely salary release under Section 7. Employees can demand unpaid wages with statutory damages under Section 15.</li>
                  <li><strong>The Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 (Section 33C):</strong> Allows workmen to recover dues directly through the Labour Court.</li>
                  <li><strong>State Shops and Establishments Acts:</strong> Regulate working hours, leave rules, and pay cycles for commercial establishments. Local labour inspectors can summon non-compliant employers.</li>
                  <li><strong>Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972:</strong> Requires gratuity payment within 30 days under Section 7. Delays attract mandatory statutory interest.</li>
                  <li><strong>Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (IBC):</strong> Treats employees as <strong className="font-extrabold text-[#111827]">Operational Creditors</strong>. A Section 8 demand notice often prompts fast settlement.</li>

                <h2 id="why-online-templates-fail">5. Why Free Online Notice Templates Fail</h2>
                <p>
                  Many people use free legal notice formats found online. These generic templates rarely deliver results:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>No Advocate Verification:</strong> Free formats lack a verified advocate signature and official letterhead. Corporate legal teams easily ignore them.</li>
                  <li><strong>Wrong Legal References:</strong> Generic templates miss state-specific Shops and Establishments Acts and workman rules under Section 2(s).</li>
                  <li><strong>No Systematic Follow-up:</strong> One lone notice is easy to overlook. Without structured escalation, employers know individuals often give up.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>

                <p>
                  To start your recovery, gather common workplace records. Our advocates will use these documents to build your claim:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Appointment Letter or Contract:</strong> Shows your role, agreed monthly pay, notice period terms, and work location.</li>
                  <li><strong>Salary Slips:</strong> Proves your pay structure and reveals any unauthorized deductions.</li>
                  <li><strong>Bank Account Statement:</strong> Serves as clear proof of unpaid wages by showing when credits stopped.</li>
                  <li><strong>Resignation or Termination Email:</strong> Verifies your last working day and settlement terms.</li>
                  <li><strong>Written Messages:</strong> Work emails, Slack messages, or WhatsApp chats proving requests for payment.</li>
                </ul>
